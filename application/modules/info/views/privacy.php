                            Certain ads appearing on our Service are delivered by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may use cookies and other similar technologies to collect data, including the technologies described above. Doing this allows the ad companies
                            to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with
                            each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you, both on our Service and elsewhere online. To learn more and to opt out of the collection of data on our website by third
                            parties for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices or www.youronlinechoices.com. Note that opting out will not affect the quantity of ads you see online but likely will cause the ads to be less relevant to
